<p>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</p>
<p> Strikingly.com (template used to create GarySheng.com) is intended to be a simple way to create a descriptive website in  minutes.  It mainly serves as an alternative or compliment to LinkedIn. Users are able to provide content in ways that they are unable to on LinkedIn. </p>

<p> Gary customized the template using his own web development skills, to create a sleek &amp unique resume. </p>

		An accelerator program seeking to disseminate info about it's program. <br>
		The website itself is functional yet bare bones. It low on user-friendliness as it posts its navigation at the bottom in very small font.

<p> Seeks to sell inconsistent tithing among church goers. I think this website effectively represents its sales driven approach.
