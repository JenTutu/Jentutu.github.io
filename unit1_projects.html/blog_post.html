<h3><a href="http://www.garysheng.com/"> Gary Sheng</a></h3>
<p> Summary: Design is simple &amp sleek. <br>
		Immediately my eye is drawn to the navigation at the top of the screen. The words are all uppercase in a very readable font, making for a seamless user experience. 
		I think Gary's introduction at the center is probably the most important area of the site. It is strategically placed against a sunset background image of the owner using a sleek font. Without knowing anything else about the owner of the site, you gather that the person probably has a good eye for quality design and is cognizant about user experience. <br>

		Taking a step back, it is important to note that this site is derived from the user templates provided by Strikingly.com. Strikingly.com is intended to be a simple way to create a descriptive website in  minutes.  It mainly serves as an alternative or compliment to LinkedIn. Users are able to provide content in ways that they are unable to on LinkedIn. 
	</p>
	<p>

		With that said, I think Gary has done a great job of taking his Strikingly profile to the next level, in order to effectively tell his story. Gary takes a multi-modal appraoch to  provide users with detail about himself:
	</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> Provides education and work history through colored text. Very eye catching &amp organized. 
	</li>
	<li> Because he customized the template using his own web development skills, this website also demonstrates his knowledge and capabilities.
	</li> 
	</ul>
	</p>
<p> After this page, I'm left with a feeling of inspiration.

	<h3><a href="http://ycombinator.com/"> Y Combinator</a></h3>
<p> Summary: Design is highly functional & less interactive.
</p>
<p>
The site is extremely practical and focuses on what it finds to be the most critical information for the first-time guest. In fact, the navigation is found at the bottom of the page, which differs from most websites, which seek to support the user by posting such links in plain view. Additionally, not only is the navigation located at the bottom, but it is written in such small typeface that it may potentially weed out certain user groups . There are however some positive user experience features that factor into the site’s presentation. For instance, all of the content is centered in the middle of the page in a stack-like manner; this is a nice feature, since there is no hassle involved with scrolling the page left and right. Essentially the page is one dimensional. Also, the page uses neutral colors to purposefully control the user’s eye. 

All in all, the main point of this websites is to provide un-cluttered information about the Y Combinator program. To do so, it seems that the developers were most concerned with providing a functional website with useful content. It is perhaps likely that this is meant to convey something about the personality of the program itself; that the founders &amp investors alike value product functionality over design.

	<h3><a href="http://www.speakerfeed.com/">Speakerfeed</a></h3>
	<p> Summary: Sales Driven
	</p>
<p>
	This site interactively draws users to learn more about their service by presenting a blinking ‘play’ sign (seen on the live version of the site).  They also strategically hold the user sign up buttons at the top of the page, such that users can sign in/up at any point on the site. Like the Gary Sheng’s site, the information is provided two-fold; visually &amp textually. 

Visually they provide examples of the user interface, to give assurance that their service is easy to use. They also make the page easy for the user to read, by sticking with the same color scheme throughout. 

Textually they use white colored font against dark backgrounds making it easy for users  to read the company’s market strengths. They also use unordered lists to help with this. 

Overall  this page is easy to navigate and gives the user something to think about.
