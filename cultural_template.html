			<h1>(Week 6) Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<div class="article_pics">
	<img src="images/girl_st.png">
	</div> 
	<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;<span id="emphasize"> Stereotype threat </span> is described as the "risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." (Steele, et al.).  As it applies to computer science and its related fields, the concept of stereotype threat may explain the dominance of White and Asian males, and likewise, the overall lack of diversity within the tech field. Although this gap can be attributed to factors such as access to education, socioeconomic status, and academic preparation, (Osborne, 2001) we also know that stereotype threat poses a unique stake in the success ensuring that the field of technology is accessible to anyone with a willingness to learn.
	</p>


	<p> The above image demostrates an example of a negative stereotype in action. The threat then to any girl wanting to perhaps pursue math as a concentration is that she will not be good enough to handle the major, simply because there is the perception that those of the female gender don't fair well in mathematical/technical fields. Her knowledge of this perception can lead to anxiety that legitimizes the stereotype that girls suck at math. <strong>This is stereotype threat. </strong></p>

	<p>I have personally felt stereotype threat as an undergrad at the University of Chicago. In choosing a major, I felt that there was negative perception that girls would not do well in computer science. So much so, that I didn't take a single computer science course in college (I did in highshool). The bigger issue is that I bought into this perception instead of being open to challenging it. I continue to strive to recognize and actively maneuver stereotype threat. </p>

	<p>Ultimately, we can conclude that stereotype threat is a rather inducible occurrence that, when negative, can hinder any group of people/persons confronted with it. Its' significance in the area of workplace diversity is extremely important as we seek to find methods to diversify the tech industry. Making employees aware of stereotype threat is important, as these stereotypes inform expectations and lead to its propagation.

	<h1> (Week 5) Privilege &amp Exposure in the discussion on Diversity</h1>
	<p>
		Several months ago I happened upon an article by programmer Philip Guo, exposing what is known as programmer privilege. In this article he details what he believes to be the privilege associated with his persona as an Asian male in tech. After reading his article, I suspect that both privilege AND exposure are apparent causes to the lack of diversity in tech. I provide a summary below:
	</p>

<h3 id="privilege">Privilege</h3>
<li> <strong> Looking the part. </strong> Guo had the benefit of the doubt from peers and professors because he looked the part: Asian, male, student at MIT
</li>
	<ul> 
		<li> <strong> Spared implicit bias. </strong> As Guo himself recounts, if he struggled with a problem set, he wasn't negatively affected by the implicit bias that other minority students in the field might experience. In fact, he notes that no one ever said to him, "Well, not everyone is cut out for computer science; have you considered majoring in bio?" <a href="week5_cultural.html"> <strong> READ MORE... </strong></a>

<h1>(Week 4) Dealing with Conflict: Follow Your Instinct</h1>
<h3> Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
<p> Being in my first full time experience, I was unsure on how to handle a hostile boss who continuously sought to put her own emotional issues onto others by constantly belittling fellow co-workers. Leading up to my decision to leave, there was an instance where we were having a meeting in preparation for an upcoming presentation. As per usual, I was asked to provide feedback on her presentation. I usually refrained from providing any sort of feedback since I could tell my boss didn't receive critique well at all; to the point where she became visibly red at the slightest mention of changing a header or color. She was difficult to work with to say the least.  </p>

<p> As we went through the ending of her presentation, she got to her summary page where I found several logical mistakes in her writing. Because I knew to tread lightly, I phrased my commentary as a question, as I asked her to explain what she meant by one of the bullet statements she listed. Her response, in front of our director, "Well, it's pretty obvious!", as she turned bright red and our director sat there saying nothing. This wasn't her first time making snappy comments that discouraged me from providing any sort of feedback, but for me, this would be the last straw. </p>

<h3>What was the source of the conflict? How did you handle that conflict? </h3>
 <p> Prior to this incident, I was noticing patterns with her; patterns of always needing to be right (i.e. degrading the client because they didn't understand what she was trying to say), a constant need to recognized, especially during times that were inappropriate (i.e. at a client meeting making the small talk entirely about herself), &amp most importantly a lack in ability to empathize with others feelings. I naturally wanted to withdraw from confrontation with her, but as a sociologist, it became too much to handle on my own. <a href="week4_cultural_blog.html"> <strong> READ MORE... </strong></a>

		<h1> (Week 3) On Pairing</h1>
		<p>Pairing was a refreshing experience since it allowed me to gather input and reassurance on what I had learned during the week. It was nice to see that another student had questions similar to mine, and could also offer insights on areas that I was unsure about. I was also able to increase confidence in my ability since pairing usually extends an opportunity to teach another person something new. Though most of my pairing has involved partners who were at roughly the same technical level as myself, there were small opportunities to help guide &amp teach. So far the pairing exeriences have shown me that it is crucial to helping cement &amp quicken my understanding of particular topics.</p>

		<p> On a meta level, I've noticed that in pairing, I'm constantly trying to make sure that I'm not too pushy. Yet, there are times when I regard myself as being too meek within the sessions. I think this is a function of the fact that I'm a total beginner.</p>

		<p> On Writing Feedback:</p>
		<p> Writing feedback was similarly rewarding since it gave me a meta view of my own understanding. I don't find writing feedback particularly hard, just that I have to remind myself to provide well thought out actionable insights. By this, I mean providing insights that would be suitable for the reader's time &amp ability. </p>
