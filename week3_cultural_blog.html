		<p> On Pairing:</p>
		<p>Pairing was a refreshing experience since it allowed me to gather input and reassurance on what I had learned during the week. It was nice to see that another student had questions similar to mine, and could also offer insights on areas that I was unsure about. I was also able to increase confidence in my ability since pairing usually extends an opportunity to teach another person something new. Though most of my pairing has involved partners who were at roughly the same technical level as myself, there were small opportunities to help guide &amp teach. So far the pairing exeriences have shown me that it is crucial to helping cement &amp quicken my understanding of particular topics.</p>

		<p> On a meta level, I've noticed that in pairing, I'm constantly trying to make sure that I'm not too pushy. Yet, there are times when I regard myself as being too meek within the sessions. I think this is a function of the fact that I'm a total beginner.</p>

		<p> On Writing Feedback:</p>
		<p> Writing feedback was similarly rewarding since it gave me a meta view of my own understanding. I don't find writing feedback particularly hard, just that I have to remind myself to provide well thought out actionable insights. By this, I mean providing insights that would be suitable for the reader's time &amp ability. </p>

<h2> Blog 3: Why is JavaScript so popular in Web Development?</h2>
<img src="images/redesign_web.jpg" id="redesign_web">
<p>There are severval reasons as to why Javascript has grown in popularity:</p>
<ul>
<li> Adds Interactivity: JS allows users to create dynamic user experiences. This is appealing as websites are created to target specific user groups. </li>

<li>Fast: JS gets to the end user relatively fast. Since JS code is executed on the user's processor as opposed to the web server, the application is immediately responsive to user input. As an added benefit, this execution on the user's processor saves bandwitdh &amp limits strain on the web server. </li>

<li> Easy to implement: Many believe that JS is relatively simple to learn &amp implement. Javascript is also versatile and can easily be inserted into any web page. </li>

	<h3> Padding</h3>
	<p> As part of the box model, the padding is defined as the space between the content and the border. There are a few ways to specify padding values within CSS:
		<ul>
			<li> With four values: 
				<ul>
					<li> padding: top right bottom left; 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> With two values: 
				<ul> 
					<li> padding: top/bottom right/left;
				    </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> With one value:
				<ul>
					<li> padding: all;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3> Border </h3>
	<p> The border is located between the padding &amp margin. This property allows you to specify the style &amp color of the border. To find out more about these properties, please visit: <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/help/css-understanding-border-margin-and-padding-properties.html"> TemplateMonster.com </a> </p>
	<h3> Margin </h3>
	<p>The margin is the space directly outside the border. The margin effectively defines how other elements outside the border will relate to the "box" surrounding the content. It is transparent as it does not take on a background color. Similar to the padding, the values for the margin can be defined three different ways.</p>
