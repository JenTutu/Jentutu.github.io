&nbsp; &nbsp;<span id="emphasize"> Stereotype threat </span> is described as the "risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." (Steele, et al.).  As it applies to computer science and its related fields, the concept of stereotype threat may explain the dominance of White and Asian males, and likewise, the overall lack of diversity within the tech field. Although this gap can be attributed to factors such as access to education, socioeconomic status, and academic preparation, (Osborne, 2001) we also know that stereotype threat poses a unique stake in the success ensuring that the field of technology is accessible to anyone with a willingness to learn.

<p> The above image demostrates an example of a negative stereotype in action. The threat then to any girl wanting to perhaps pursue math as a concentration is that she will not be good enough to handle the major, simply because there is the perception that those of the female gender don't fair well in mathematical/technical fields. Her knowledge of this perception can lead to anxiety that legitimizes the stereotype that girls suck at math. <strong>This is stereotype threat. </strong></p>

<p>I have personally felt stereotype threat as an undergrad at the University of Chicago. In choosing a major, I felt that there was negative perception that girls would not do well in computer science. So much so, that I didn't take a single computer science course in college (I did in highshool). The bigger issue is that I bought into this perception instead of being open to challenging it. I continue to strive to recognize and actively maneuver stereotype threat. </p>

<p>Ultimately, we can conclude that stereotype threat is a rather inducible occurrence that, when negative, can hinder any group of people/persons confronted with it. Its' significance in the area of workplace diversity is extremely important as we seek to find methods to diversify the tech industry. Making employees aware of stereotype threat is important, as these stereotypes inform expectations and lead to its propagation.
