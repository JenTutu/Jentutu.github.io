	<h2> Blog 5: Privilege &amp Exposure in the discussion on Diversity</h2>
	<p>
		Several months ago I happened upon an article by programmer Philip Guo, exposing what is known as programmer privilege. In this article he details what he believes to be the privilege associated with his persona as an Asian male in tech. After reading his article, I suspect that both privilege AND exposure are apparent causes to the lack of diversity in tech. I provide a summary below:
	</p>


<p> </p>



<h3 id="privilege">Privilege</h3>
<li> <strong> Looking the part. </strong> Guo had the benefit of the doubt from peers and professors because he looked the part: Asian, male, student at MIT
</li>
	<ul> 
		<li> <strong> Spared implicit bias. </strong> As Guo himself recounts, if he struggled with a problem set, he wasn't negatively affected by the implicit bias that other minority students in the field might experience. In fact, he notes that no one ever said to him, "Well, not everyone is cut out for computer science; have you considered majoring in bio?"
		</li> 
	</ul>

	<h3 id="exposure"> Exposure</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Programming from an early age.</strong> His parents (and/or other adults) exposed him to computers at an early age. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Though none of these points on their own lead to the disproportionate lack of minorities in the field, the sum of these provide the outcome we observe today. This concept is best described by researcher Mary Rowe. Looking at privilege and exposure as micro-inequities, her explanation is well-suited for what we witness in the tech industry: 
		</p>
<div id="quote">
<p>"[M]icro-inequities often had serious cumulative, harmful effects, resulting in hostile work environments and continued minority discrimination in public and private workplaces and organizations."</p>
</div>
	<p> Overall, it seems to me that the problem of diversity facing tech is about access. Addressing the issue of access while providing successful examples of minorities in tech should help to alleviate the shortage of  well qualified minorities in the tech field.</p>

<!-- Several months ago I happened upon an article exposing what is known as programmer privilege.  

“Psychology Today notes that according to one researcher, Mary Rowe:
[M]icro-inequities often had serious cumulative, harmful effects, resulting in hostile work environments and continued minority discrimination in public and private workplaces and organizations. What makes micro-inequities particularly problematic is that they consist in micro-messages that are hard to recognize for victims, bystanders and perpetrators alike. When victims of micro-inequities do recognize the micro-messages … it is exceedingly hard to explain to others why these small behaviors can be a huge problem.”

Assume that instead of workplaces and organizations, these micro-inequities are taking place in schools. That is what leads to programmer privilege as programmer Philip Guo has noted.

Privilege: 
He was given the benefit of the doubt because he looed the part (Asian Male student at MIT)
