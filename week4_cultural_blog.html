<h1>(Week 4) Dealing with Conflict: Follow Your Instinct</h1>
<h3> Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
<p> Being in my first full time experience, I was unsure on how to handle a hostile boss who continuously sought to put her own emotional issues onto others by constantly belittling fellow co-workers. Leading up to my decision to leave, there was an instance where we were having a meeting in preparation for an upcoming presentation. As per usual, I was asked to provide feedback on her presentation. I usually refrained from providing any sort of feedback since I could tell my boss didn't receive critique well at all; to the point where she became visibly red at the slightest mention of changing a header or color. She was difficult to work with to say the least.  </p>

<p> As we went through the ending of her presentation, she got to her summary page where I found several logical mistakes in her writing. Because I knew to tread lightly, I phrased my commentary as a question, as I asked her to explain what she meant by one of the bullet statements she listed. Her response, in front of our director, "Well, it's pretty obvious!", as she turned bright red and our director sat there saying nothing. This wasn't her first time making snappy comments that discouraged me from providing any sort of feedback, but for me, this would be the last straw. </p>

<h3>What was the source of the conflict? How did you handle that conflict? </h3>
 <p> Prior to this incident, I was noticing patterns with her; patterns of always needing to be right (i.e. degrading the client because they didn't understand what she was trying to say), a constant need to recognized, especially during times that were inappropriate (i.e. at a client meeting making the small talk entirely about herself), &amp most importantly a lack in ability to empathize with others feelings. I naturally wanted to withdraw from confrontation with her, but as a sociologist, it became too much to handle on my own. Over time, it was clear to me that she had some variety of narcissistic personality disorder, as she was constantly displaying egocentric behavior. Literally every conversation and meeting had to start and end with an often inappropriate story about herself, even when the topic had nothing to do with her life AT ALL. I could legitimately be talking about meeting Oprah and she would interrupt the conversation to talk about how her dad sold his football tickets or how she encountered a long line at grocery store the day before. Wha? Do you see my pain? Am I being punked? Are they filming The Office and no one told me? As I started to speak with others, it was evident that people dealt with her by simply avoiding her (whereas she herself, of course, thought she was well liked); I, unfortunately, had to work closely with her, and others were worried about my state of mind, to the point that they were encouraging me to find a new supervisor...every week.</p>

 <p> I make mention of these things so that you understand my feelings during the latest confrontation involving her presentation. As she snapped at me saying, "it's pretty obvious!", I felt a range of emotions in my body. As I naturally withdraw, and because we working under a deadline for that afternoon, I decided to finish the work I needed to finish, and deal with her later. So that's what I did. </p>

 <p> I finished the work and then I stepped into her office and closed the door (because I wanted to display some level of respect in the way I handled the situation). I spoke in a calm voice and let her know that the type of behavior she displayed was both rude and unnecessary. I reminded her of how I've been able to receive her criticism and that I didn't appreciate the way she handled that situation, especially since she and the director were consistently asking me more for more feedback. Overall, I stood up for myself. A few weeks later, I submitted my resignation. Of course, she was stunned because she is unable to process how her actions are seen by others.</p>

 <h3>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h3>
 <p> After our meeting in her office, I'm pretty sure she had a 1hr talk with our director where she probably lied her way through and belittled me, much like she did throughout my time spent working with her. I saw no change in her behavior, again because I sincerely believe she is suffering (medically) with a strong undiagnosed form of egocentrism. </p>

 <h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
 <p> I would have left that position WAY sooner, or better yet, I would have trusted my instinct and never agreed to work with her in the first place. Though I initially had the inkling that I wasn't going to enjoy working in that environment, I was unable to articulate this feeling to myself. Since I often rely on intellect, it wasn't enough for me to just feel like something was off. Having had this experience, I realize that there is wisdom in the body; I've learned to trust my instinct. </p>
