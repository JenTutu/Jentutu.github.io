		<h1>(Week 9) Thinking Style</h1>
<p>Prompt:Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else. If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place. 
	</p>

<p>
Being an Abstract sequential thinker &amp a multimodal learner, I like to feel confident with each topic through thorough reviews from many different sources. Often times I will look at 2-4 mixed media sources (i.e. video, text, etc.) to make sure that I understand a topic to my satisfaction. The problem is that this takes up a lot of time. Lately I've been able to navigate this better by asking for help and input from classmates sooner rather than later. Rather than spending too much time trying to navigate to an answer on my own, I've become aware of when and why I'm hitting a wall, and have been better about seeking help from those who have come across the problem before. Through asking others, I have found that there are times when another person can offer important insight on how to go around the wall rather than through it.
</p>


<p> While I mostly identify with the description for an Abstract sequential thinker, I also note that there are certain characteristics that do not fit with me. For instance, I actually work better in noisy environments even though I am prone to working through a challenge on my own. I think the noise helps me to get into the "flow" better, but also gives me some reassurance that I can think through a problem with someone next to me. Of course, because of the tendency (noted earlier) to stay too long with a problem, working in a noisy environment also pushes me to work with others. Being able to explain a challenge to another person also helps to confirm my understanding and check my assumptions. </p>

<p> Over the course of Phase 0, I've picked up some key insights about "being in the flow" and getting things done. I've listed those that resonate most with me:
	<ul>

	<li>
		If after two google searches I am unable to implement the task I'm working on, I will ask for help from others.
	</li>
    <li>Setting clear goals- when, where, who, how </li>
    <li>
    	Getting immediate feedback from trusted sources on my work
    </li>
    <li>
    	Having no fear of failure - asking questions instead of letting them sit too long
    </li>
    <li>
    	Moving on from a topic that I'm struggling with and returning to it a couple of hours/days later - often times the brain will process the information in the background and understanding the topic becomes easier with time. 
    </li>
    <li> Stop letting perfection become my goal early on in the process; rather seeking functional first, then balancing later</li>

</ul>
