		<!--How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat?

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down at DBC? -->
	

		<p>I think my ability to address stereotype threat relates back to having a growth mindset. As a reminder, the growth mindset perceives talents and abilities as things that can be developed over time. This is in contrast to a fixed mindset, which believes that abilities and intelligence are pre-determined traits that are simply fixed. I believe that maintaining a growth mindset will help to offset stereotype threat since stereotype threat is all about a belief that a group of people inherently have some characteristic that makes them intrinsically good or bad at some activity. In the case of Asian students, there is a positive stereotype dictating that they will outperform their peers on standardized testing. However, I believe that their success has more to do with the culture of hard work and productivity. Thus, I constantly remove myself from the belief that I am intrinsically bad at some thing because of my ethnicity, gender, etc., and instead believe that through enough deliberate practice, I can become good at whatever it is I'm seeking to accomplish. </p>

		<p> In terms of what I will do to make sure that I maintain this growth mindset:<br>
		 I will include exercise as part of my daily routine, in order to release stress. I will also respect the wisdom of my body and realize that there are times when giving myself rest or taking a break from a project will actually help me to be more productive.</p>
