	<p> I have always noticed a disconnect between traditional schooling and how the real world operates. The real world expects you to produce while the U.S. educational system expects (and many others) and rewards those who consume. In keeping with his kitchen vs. table mentality, Shareef breaks it down like this; school expects you to open your mouth wide, feast on the information they pour into you, then regurgitate out that same information. On the flipside, DBC and much of software engineering in general, is about using the information you're given to create new &amp rich dishes.</p>

	<p> Though it may be a bit uncomfortable at first, getting into the kitchen mentality is for me further preparation for entering entrepreneurship. As I think about it, the kitchen mentality is the real reason I became interested in software engineering. I wanted to start producing; I want to have the power to build out my own ideas and share them in a way that the rest of the world could consume. I believe that as I become more engaged with the process of slicing and dicing code (pun intended), I'll begin to break away from the mold of consumption as usual and gain confidence in mixing and designing to create entirely new menus. </p>
