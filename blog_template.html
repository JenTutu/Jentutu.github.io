	<h2>Blog 4: Arrays vs. Hashes: What are they? What are they good for? </h2> 

	<h3>What is an Array?</h3>

		<p>
		An array is simply a list arrangement of objects with no restrictions on type. For instance an array that mixes Integers and Strings is perfectly valid (i.e. array=[1,'one',2,'two']) within Ruby. 
		</p>
		<p> Creating an array is fairly simple. You can build an array by placing a set of values within brackets[], i.e.:</p>
			<ul>
			<li class="ruby"> [1,2,3] </li>
			</ul>
		<p> More often than not, you will want to name the array so that you can access it later.</p>
			<ul>
			<li class="ruby"> named_array=[1,2,3] <br>
			<class="comments"> #name_of_array=[object1,object2]</li>
			</ul>
</div>


<div id="Hash">
	<h3>What is a Hash?</h3>
		<p> A hash, similar to an array, is simply a collection of objects in no particular order. 
		</p>
		<p> Typically, hashes are used to represent items and their associated values. For instance, if I wanted to be able to access a list of books by author, I could do so like this: <span class="link_box"> <a href="week4_technical.html"> READ MORE...</a></span>

<h2> Blog 3: Why is JavaScript so popular in Web Development?</h2>
<img src="images/redesign_web.jpg" id="redesign_web">
<p>There are severval reasons as to why Javascript has grown in popularity:</p>
<ul>
<li> Adds Interactivity: JS allows users to create dynamic user experiences. This is appealing as websites are created to target specific user groups. </li>

<li>Fast: JS gets to the end user relatively fast. Since JS code is executed on the user's processor as opposed to the web server, the application is immediately responsive to user input. As an added benefit, this execution on the user's processor saves bandwitdh &amp limits strain on the web server. </li>

<li> Easy to implement: Many believe that JS is relatively simple to learn &amp implement. Javascript is also versatile and can easily be inserted into any web page. </li>
</ul>

	<h3> Padding</h3>
	<p> As part of the box model, the padding is defined as the space between the content and the border. There are a few ways to specify padding values within CSS:
		<ul>
			<li> With four values: 
				<ul>
					<li> padding: top right bottom left; 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> With two values: 
				<ul> 
					<li> padding: top/bottom right/left;
				    </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> With one value:
				<ul>
					<li> padding: all;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3> Border </h3>
	<p> The border is located between the padding &amp margin. This property allows you to specify the style &amp color of the border. To find out more about these properties, please visit: <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/help/css-understanding-border-margin-and-padding-properties.html"> TemplateMonster.com </a> </p>
	<h3> Margin </h3>
	<p>The margin is the space directly outside the border. The margin effectively defines how other elements outside the border will relate to the "box" surrounding the content. It is transparent as it does not take on a background color. Similar to the padding, the values for the margin can be defined three different ways.</p>
