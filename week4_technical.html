<title> Arrays vs. Hashes </title>
<body> 
<h2>Blog 4: Arrays vs. Hashes: What are they? What are they good for? </h2> 
<div id="Hash">
<h3>What is a Hash?</h3>
<p> A hash, similar to an array, is simply a collection of objects. </p>
<p> Typically, hashes are used to represent data structures. For instance, if I wanted to be able to access a list of books, I could do so like this: </p>
<div class="ruby">
<p> books = {} <br>
	books[:matz]= "The Ruby Lang" <br>
	books[:black] = "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" <br>
	<class="comments"> #name of hash[:name of key]= "value" 
</p>
</div>
	<p> This brings me to another point. How do you create a Hash? There are two ways:
		<ul> Example 1: Using Hash Literal
			<li class="ruby"> ages={"Genevieve Dior" => 24, "Naomi Cisse"=>26} <br>
			 <class="comments"> #name of hash= {"key1"=> value1, "key2"=> value2} </li>
		</ul>
		<ul> Example 2: Using ::new method
			<li class="ruby"> ages=Hash.new<br>
			ages["Genevieve Dior"]=24 <br>
			<class="comments">#name of hash["name of key"]=value </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>When to Use an Array vs. a Hash</p>
	<p>Not surprisingly, deciding when to use an Array over a Hash will be dependent on the situation. As I mentioned before, because a hash represents a data structure, hashes are an excellent choice for when you want to displate items that are associated with one another. An example can be found in displaying menu items with their associated costs: 
	</p>
	
	<p class="ruby">
		<ul> Example 3: Menu Items &amp Prices 
		restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 } <br>
		restaurant_menu.each do | item, price | <br>
		puts "#{item}: $#{price}"<br>
		end <br>
		<ul> => Dal Makhani: $4 <br>
			Coffee: $2 <br>
			Ramen: $3 <br>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> Since arrays are useful for storing one-dimensional data, they are useful for looking up data using an index. 
		<ul>
			Example 4: An Array of a student group <br>
studentArray = ["Ajay Bir Singh", "Jennifer Oseitutu", "Andrew Principe", "Joseph Rosztoczy"] 
		</ul>
	</p>
